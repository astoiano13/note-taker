For this assignment I looked back a lot on our in class exercises to figure out proper routes etc.
I'm not sure if I utilized them properly but I got stuck on trying to create the POST API routes. I just need to spend more time on this stuff to figure it out. I also wasn't sure if it was worth deploying the work to Heroku when the app doesn't work properly yet...
